        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <h3>1.1 Purpose &amp; Product Scope</h3>
        <p>The product whose requirements are specified in this document is <i>Database on Web</i>. We propose a
            mobile-optimised version of well-known web-based relational database administration systems such as <i>Adminer</i>,
            <i>phpMyAdmin</i> or collaborative ones, such as <i>DB Fiddle</i>. The present document addresses only the end-user
            front-end workflow requirements.</p>
        <h3>1.2 Product Scope</h3>
        <p>The specified software product is intended as a robust, practical and mobile tool for managing relational
            databases, regardless of the used terminal (smartphone, tablet or desktop PC).</p>

        <h2>2. Overall description</h2>
        <h3>2.1 Product perspective</h3>
        <p>The context in which the specified product is intended for operation is the world-wide web, which doesn't
            possess yet a comfortable enough database management system to be used on every terminal (especially
            smartphones).</p>

        <h3>2.2 Product functions</h3>
        <p>The application has the following features:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>account-based access</li>
            <li>account administration functions: reset password, change e-mail, delete account, etc.</li>
            <li>mail notifications regarding future products and surveys</li>
            <li>collaborative editing</li>
            <li>basic CRUD operations on data</li>
            <li>SQL command/script execution</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 User Classes and Characteristics</h3>
        <p>We expect the product's users to have a certain degree of expertise regarding the relational database model
            and the SQL language.</p>

        <h3>2.4 Operating Environment</h3>
        <p>The software will operate within any modern web browser, provided they are updated to their latest
            versions.</p>

        <h3>2.5 Design and Implementation Constraints</h3>
        <p>The software application's interface had to be written entirely from scratch using HTML5, CSS3 and vanilla
            JavaScript out of educational purposes.</p>

        <h3>2.6 User Documentation</h3>
        <p>The user's manual will be provided as the application continues to grow and will be shipped with the finished
            product.</p>

        <h3>2.7 Assumptions and Dependencies</h3>
        <p>The application is constrained by newer HTML and CSS standards and therefore expects the user to run it on a
            compatible browser. The user's manual will include minimum versions of popular browsers required to run the
            product properly.</p>

        <h2>3. External Interface Requirements</h2>
        <h3>3.1 User Interfaces</h3>
        <h4>3.1.1 Login page</h4>
        <div>
            <p>The first page an unauthenticated user should see is the login page, where he can enter his credentials
                and proceed to the home page of the application. If he doesn't have any account, he should be able to
                register from the same page. Successful registration is followed by another login attempt.</p>
        </div>

        <h4>3.1.2 Home page</h4>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>The pages following the home page should contain a persistent navigation bar with buttons for
                    returning
                    to the home page, changing account settings, toggling between a light and a dark theme,
                    collaborating
                    with someone (generating an unique link for another registered users' access) and logging out.
                </li>
                <li>On the
                    left side of the home page a database list (on mobile devices, it should be hidden, except when
                    floating
                    over the page only after toggling its visibility with a button placed immediately above, on the
                    navigation bar). From it, the user can select a database or find one by its name.
                </li>
                <li>The rest of the page
                    is filled with a floating command panel (bar) including (but not limited to) the following commands:
                    open an SQL prompt, querying and searching through a table using the GUI, database import and export
                    functionality, viewing all table views; the page should also contain tables from the selected
                    database,
                    having their fields described, each within its card. Each such card contains at the bottom buttons
                    for
                    dropping the table, altering the corresponding table and viewing its data.
                </li>
                <li>An user should be able to
                    create new tables on this page by entering their name and number of columns, and, at a later point
                    in
                    time, specify the definitions of its columns. He should also have the possibility of creating a new
                    database on the same page.
                </li>
                <li>In the page footer, a contact button should display on pressing it the
                    authors' contact info.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h4>3.1.3 SQL command prompt</h4>
        <div>
            <p>The SQL prompt should be separated in two parts: one for introducing commands and another one for their
                computed output. They should be separated by a run button. The user should also have the option to
                display the results as a table (to be implemented at a later date).</p>
        </div>

            </li>
            <li>
                <p>each user must be aware that any potential data breach poses a real threat to any sensitive data
                    stored in their database(s) and the authors assume no additional responsability when the user
                    uploads such data</p>
